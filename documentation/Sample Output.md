Waiting on you...
[YOU] Hey
[BOT] You see the new fast and furious movie yet?
[YOU] Yeah!
[BOT] I guess there's always a new one.
[YOU] The new movies are so good!
[BOT] Yeah same ol gets boring
[YOU] You didn't like the new movie?
[BOT] I like the Rock, he makes them a bit more fun.
[YOU] The rock is a really cool character
[BOT] I loved his car too. It looked really cool.
[YOU] I know! His car was really beautiful
[BOT] Ford Mustang.
[YOU] Ford makes good cars
[BOT] Yep. Fast back 1967.
[YOU] They have quite an amazing history, don't they?
[BOT] Then no, I don't think they will stop making them.
[YOU] I'm sure they will keep making fast and furious movies
[BOT] No.  I definitely think this series is beyond played out and should cease immediately.
[YOU] You don't think more movies would be nice?
[BOT] I thought so, since he did some crazy things.
[YOU] Yeah the movies have pulled off some crazy stunts!
[BOT] I know just what you mean, but that fit scene in the dress was epic.
[YOU] I think I remember that! They were prepping for the big finale standoff, right?
[BOT] Yeah, the first one was more about street racing and cars.
[YOU] Exactly, then it moved more into heists and revenge, a cool plot progression
[BOT] Its so fun to watch
[YOU] It definitely is a fun series to enjoy
[BOT] I think it's made for idiots. I don't get the appeal.
[YOU] It's made for idiots?
[BOT] It's supposed to be ridiculous. It's over the top and the corny dialogue makes it even better.
[YOU] Yeah I think the creators know who their audience is
[BOT] Furious 5 is the first film where Rock plays the DSS agent
[YOU] Oh is it? The rock plays that hardened agent role well
[BOT] Yeah, that's why I remember I have it.
[YOU] You have the memory in your mind?
[BOT] well i am trying to recall a specific actor
[YOU] Oh I see, which role did that actor play in the movies?
[BOT] Anyways, there are lots of other characters which can be removed.
[YOU] Yeah, I think many characters were quite trivial
[BOT] Then no, I don't think they will stop making them.
[YOU] Ah I see, they probably will keep putting in more characters to raise tension
[BOT] Yeah that was a little off putting for me too.
[YOU] It's like most characters don't really get development, it's frustrating
[BOT] What didn't you understand?
[YOU] I just didn't know why some characters were there, it seemed they were just written in to add artificial drama
[BOT] Was part 2 good?
[YOU] Part 2 was a little better, but the problem of underdeveloped characters was still there I think
[BOT] The second and third one are good. I like how they take the characters and stayed true to the original.
[YOU] That's a good point, the movies are quite rigid to their character cores
[BOT] Who is your favorite actor in the series?
[YOU] Vin Diesel for sure, he's great
[BOT] Oh yeah, I like Ludacris.
[YOU] Ludacris is cool too!
[BOT] Tyrese is very smooth in his acting skills and he has been acting for a while now.
[YOU] Definitely a professional actor!
[BOT] I love Vin Diesel! He's so good in it!
[YOU] I know, right? He really sells his character well
[BOT] Just one of the best scenes in the whole series
[YOU] Which scene?
[BOT] Hard to say. One of my favorites is when they drive the semi backwards.
[YOU] That was really cool, I agree
[BOT] I loved his car too. It looked really cool.
